**Qodana** is a code quality monitoring platform that allows you to evaluate the integrity of code you own, contract, or purchase. It brings into your CI/CD pipelines all the smart features you love in the JetBrains IDEs plus continues adding project-level checks like clone detection and license audit.

Qodana Python is based on PyCharm Professional and provides static analysis for Python projects.
